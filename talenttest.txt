The IEA's Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) 
is a series of international assessments of the mathematics and science knowledge 
of students around the world. 
In each of the participating educational systems, a minimum of 4,500 to 5,000 students is evaluated. Contextual data about the conditions in which participating students learn mathematics and science are collected from the students and their teachers, their principals, and their parents via questionnaires
TIMSS is one of the studies established by IEA aimed at allowing educational systems worldwide to compare students' educational achievement and learn from the experiences of others in designing effective education policy. This assessment was first conducted in 1995, and has been administered every four years thereafter. 
 TIMSS assesses 4th and 8th grade students, while TIMSS Advanced assesses students in the final year of secondary school in advanced mathematics and physics.

Fourth grade students are expected to spend, on average, 18 minutes on each item block, and eighth grade students, 22½ minutes. Consequently, the 28 blocks of fourth grade items are estimated to contain almost 8½ hours of testing time and the eighth grade blocks about 10½ hours. In previous TIMSS cycles, National Research Coordinators from participating countries agreed that the testing time for any one student should not be increased from previous assessments. Thus, as in the past, the assessment time for each student booklet must fit into 72 minutes for the fourth grade and 90 minutes for the eighth grade. An additional 30 minutes for a student questionnaire also was planned at each grade level.

In choosing how to distribute assessment blocks across student achievement booklets, the major goal was to maximize coverage of the framework while ensuring that every student responded to sufficient items to provide reliable measurement of trends in both mathematics and science. A further goal was to ensure that achievement in the mathematics and science content and cognitive domains could be measured reliably. To enable linking among booklets while keeping the number of booklets to a minimum, each block appears in two booklets. TIMSS has used the same booklet design since 2007.

The TIMSS 2019 booklet design shows how the 28 assessment blocks are distributed across 14 student achievement booklets (see Exhibit 4.2). The fourth and eighth grade booklet designs are identical, although the fourth grade blocks contain 18 minutes of assessment items and the eighth grade blocks 22½ minutes. Each student booklet consists of four blocks of items: two blocks of mathematics items, and two of science items. In half of the booklets, the two mathematics blocks come first, and then the two science blocks, and in the other half the order is reversed. Additionally, in most booklets two of the blocks contain trend items from TIMSS 2015 and two contain items newly developed for TIMSS 2019. For example, as may be seen from Exhibit 4.2, students assigned Booklet 1 complete two blocks of mathematics items, M01 and M02, and two blocks of science items, S01 and S02. The items in blocks M01 and S01 are trend items from TIMSS 2015, while those in M02 and S02 are items new for TIMSS 2019. Similarly, students assigned Booklet 2 complete two science blocks, S02 and S03, followed by two mathematics blocks, M02 and M03. S02 and M02 contain the new items and S03 and M03 the trend items.

Countries participating in TIMSS aim for a sample of at least 4,000 students to ensure that there are enough respondents for each item. The 14 student booklets are distributed among the students in each sampled class according to a predetermined order, so that approximately equal proportions of students respond to each booklet.

The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a worldwide study
 by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 
in member and non-member nations intended to evaluate educational systems
 by measuring 15-year-old school pupils' scholastic performance on
 mathematics, science, and reading.[1] It was first performed in 2000 and then repeated every three years. Its aim is to provide comparable data with a view to enabling countries to improve their education policies and outcomes. It measures problem solving and cognition
 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) surveyed ariund the world => PISA
students must be aged between 15 years and 3 months and 16 years
 and 2 months at the beginning of the assessment period.
Only students at school are tested, not home-schoolers
• Students also answered a background questionnaire, which
took 35 minutes to complete. The questionnaire sought
information about the students themselves, their homes,
and their school and learning experiences. School principals
completed a questionnaire that covered the school system
and the learning environment. For additional information, some
countries/economies decided to distribute a questionnaire
to teachers. It was the first time that this optional teacher
questionnaire was offered to PISA-participating countries/
economies. In some countries/economies, optional
questionnaires were distributed to parents, who were asked
to provide information on their perceptions of and involvement
in their child’s school, their support for learning in the home,
and their child’s career expectations, particularly in science.
Countries could choose two other optional questionnaires for
students: one asked students about their familiarity with and use
of information and communication technologies; and the second
sought information about students’ education to date, including
any interruptions in their schooling, and whether and how they
are preparing for a future career.
